    <p><i>I don't like to do anything, so here is a cloud crying a rainbow</i></p>
    <p>From this class, I hope to get stellar answers to interview questions, along with a pony. What does a pony have to do with this? Well, I like to remain optimistic in life, and I have always wanted a pony. Specifically one with luscious black hair and breath that smells like jellybeans. Who is to say that I won't get this pony? Do you have the audacity to say I will not get this pony in this class? If you do, then you, sir, are no friend of mine, and I will fill your halloween candy with thumbtacks. Beware. For. I. Do. Not. FORGET.</p>
